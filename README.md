# Multiple-regression-in-Predicting-Insurance-Charges

Health costs have been sharply increasing for years, remaining a significant point of concern for many families. This leads to insurance charges as a solution to help individuals be able to cover their medical bills.

The objective of this project is to predict the insurance charges based on each individual’s health and economic conditions. By using statistical analysis, this report gives insights on how individual information affects one’s charges; besides, with multiple linear regression models, it is possible to predict individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
